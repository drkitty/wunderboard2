Most of the source files contain a license section. Here are the licenses for
those that don't.

This is a copy of the FatFs license document that included in the source codes.

Therefore FatFs license is one of the BSD-style license but there is a big
difference. Because FatFs is for embedded projects, the conditions for
redistributions in binary form, such as embedded code, hex file and binary
library, is not specified to increase its usability. The documentation of the
distributions need not include about FatFs and its license document, and it may
also. Of course FatFs is compatible with the projects under GNU GPL. When
redistribute it with any modification, the license can also be changed to GNU
GPL or BSD-style license.
